## Syntax
```C
HRESULT 
WINAPI 
LocateSavedStateFiles( 
    _In_        LPCWSTR                     VmName, 
    _In_opt_    LPCWSTR                     SnapshotName, 
    _Out_       LPWSTR*                     BinPath, 
    _Out_       LPWSTR*                     VsvPath, 
    _Out_       LPWSTR*                     VmrsPath 
    ); 
```
### Parameters

`VmName`

Supplies the VM name for which the saved state file will be located.

`SnapshotName`

Supplies an optional snapshot name to locate its saved state file on relation to the given VM name. 

`BinPath`

Returns a pointer to a NULL-terminated string containing the full path name to the BIN file. The caller must call LocalFree on the returned pointer in order to release the memory occupied by the string. 

`VsvPath`

Returns a pointer to a NULL-terminated string containing the full path name to the VSV file. The caller must call LocalFree on the returned pointer in order to release the memory occupied by the string. 

`VmrsPath`

Returns a pointer to a NULL-terminated string containing the full path name to the VMRS file. The caller must call LocalFree on the returned pointer in order to release the memory occupied by the string. 

## Return Value

If the operation completes successfully, the return value is `S_OK`. Otherwise, `E_OUTOFMEMORY` indicates there was insufficient memory to return the full path(s) or other `HRESULT` failure codes might be returned.

## Remarks

Locates the saved state file(s) for a given VM and/or snapshot. This function uses WMI and the V1 or V2 virtualization namespace. So this is expected to fail if ran on a machine without Hyper-V installed. 
- If the given VM has a VMRS file, parameters BinPath and VsvPath will be a single null terminator character. 
- If the given VM has BIN and VSV files, parameter VmrsPath will be a single null terminator character. 
- If no saved state files are found, all three returned string parameters will be single null terminator characters.
